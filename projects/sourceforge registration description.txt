Output Inspector tells Kate to jump to correct file and location of error in C# compiler output.  It is a standalone helper app for kate which I may eventually make into a Kate plugin.  It is available for immediate upload with code, readme, and install script.

Future plans:
-lower requirements (Compiles in QtDevelop with qt4)
-parse exception output from binaries
-parse other compiler output (c++?)
-Kate plugin
