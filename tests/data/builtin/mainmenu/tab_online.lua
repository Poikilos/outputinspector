-- This is only a stub to allow the test to work. OutputInspector
-- un-mangling works by checking for an existing file that matches the
-- traceback, using "..." as a wildcard.
--
-- If the test worked, you will see a full path instead of one with an ellipsis
-- in each traceback step, and clicking it in your IDE (VSCode tested)
-- on any operating system should work.
--
-- During real operation (not testing), the working directory should be
-- the minetest directory containing both builtin and bin, and the
-- real file should appear instead of this test file.
